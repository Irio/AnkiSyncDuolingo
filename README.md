# AnkiSyncDuolingo
Pull your Duolingo vocabulary into Anki, as an Anki plugin

This plugin is under development, however it does work. To deploy, unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/JASchilz/AnkiSyncDuolingo/releases) directly into your Anki plugins directory. After unzipping, the `duolingo_sync.py` file and the `duolingo_sync` directory should both reside directly in your plugins directory. Then, start Anki and select Tools ~> Sync Duolingo.

I'll be updating this repository soon with inteded feature issues, etc.
